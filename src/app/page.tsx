            For generations, devotees have recited the sacred <b>Vishnu
            Sahasranamam</b> in the form of hymns. By the divine will of the
            Almighty, I have humbly presented the <b>Vishnu Sahasranamam</b> in a new
            way—through <b>Raga Malika</b> and <b>Swaras</b>—with the guidance of learned
            music scholars and the heartfelt participation of music lovers who
            revere the holy names of Lord Vishnu. <br /> <br /> I now envision bringing
            together <b>10,000 voices</b> to sing the <b>Dasa Sahasra Galarchana</b> .
            Out of the countless devotees of Sanatana Dharma, I seek only 10,000
            to unite for this divine cause. If 100 people each inspire 10
            others, we will gather 1,000; and if these 1,000 inspire 10 each, we
            shall reach our goal of 10,000 singers. My dream is for 10,000
            people to sing together on one platform while 10 lakh devotees
            listen, joining their hearts in devotion. <br /><br />Though this vision is
            vast, I believe—with the grace of the Lord—it can surely be
            realized. I call upon <b>100 devoted individuals</b> to walk with me in
            this <b>Mahayagna</b> today: some to sing, some to listen, and some to
            serve. <br /><br /> Together, we can make this offering a reality. In this
            <b>Kaliyuga</b> , nothing is greater than the remembrance of the holy
            name of Vishnu. If we dedicate ourselves for even one year—365
            days—in His remembrance, our lives will be blessed and purified.
            With folded hands and faith in His grace, I invite you to join me in
            this sacred endeavor. <br /> <br />🙏<b><em>Thank you. </em></b>🙏
